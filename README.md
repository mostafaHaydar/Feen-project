# Feen 

**Feen** is an open-source platform designed to help families reunite with lost members. The name "Feen" translates to "Where" in Arabic, symbolizing the search for lost individuals. This project provides a web interface where users can report missing or found people, and the system will attempt to match individuals based on facial recognition technology.

## Project Overview

Feen is built with the vision to help people in their most difficult times by providing a simple and effective way to search for missing individuals. It is designed to be easily accessible to everyone, and contributions from developers are encouraged.

## Key Features
- **Lost and Found Reports**: Users can report missing persons or found persons, and the system will attempt to find matches.
- **Facial Recognition**: The core functionality relies on facial recognition technology to match lost and found individuals.
- **Arabic Language Support**: The platform currently only supports Arabic language for its user interface.
- **Open Source**: This project is open to contributions from developers to help fix bugs, add features, and improve the system.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Basic structure and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and design for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and connecting the frontend to the backend.
